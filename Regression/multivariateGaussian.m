function p = multivariateGaussian(X, mu, Sigma2)
%    p = MULTIVARIATEGAUSSIAN(X, mu, Sigma2) Computes the probability 
%    density function of the examples X under the multivariate gaussian 
%    distribution with parameters mu and Sigma2. If Sigma2 is a matrix, it is
%    treated as the covariance matrix. If Sigma2 is a vector, it is treated
%    as the \sigma^2 values of the variances in each dimension (a diagonal
%    covariance matrix)
%    X should have dimension n by k, where n is the number of samples and k
%    is the number of features (base functions)
%    Normalized distribution and vectorized implementation

k = length(mu); %Dimension of the Gaussian

if (size(Sigma2, 2) == 1) || (size(Sigma2, 1) == 1)
    Sigma2 = diag(Sigma2);
end

X = bsxfun(@minus, X, mu(:)'); %(:) makes mu a column vector so it does not matter if input is row or column vector
p = (2 * pi) ^ (- k / 2) * det(Sigma2) ^ (-0.5) * ...
    exp(-0.5 * sum(bsxfun(@times, X * pinv(Sigma2), X), 2));
